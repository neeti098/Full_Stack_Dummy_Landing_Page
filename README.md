# Full_Stack_Dummy_Landing_Page
I have created a stylish full stack dummy landing page using html, css and javascript.
This project is a stylish dark-themed landing page for a fintech business, designed to be visually appealing and highly functional. It incorporates a modern and sleek design using a combination of black and blue colors, enhanced with a touch of purple.

Features
Responsive Header and Footer: The header and footer are designed with a gradient effect, combining blue and black colors for a modern look. The navigation menu is positioned on the right side for a streamlined layout.
Image Carousel: The landing page features a dynamic image carousel that cycles through three images every 3 seconds. Each image displays a different message, welcoming users to the website and providing information about Ekarth Ventures and their mission.
User Data Form: A user-friendly form allows for the collection of user data, including username, password, gender, and skills. The form includes:
Username Validation: Ensures the username is between 4 and 32 characters.
Password Validation: Ensures the password is alphanumeric and contains at least one special character.
Interactive Elements: Includes radio buttons for gender selection and a dropdown for selecting skills.
Form Submission Feedback: Displays a success message upon valid submission and prevents submission if the criteria are not met.
Enhanced User Experience: Leveraging Bootstrap for responsive design and custom CSS for a dark theme, the page provides a seamless user experience across devices.
